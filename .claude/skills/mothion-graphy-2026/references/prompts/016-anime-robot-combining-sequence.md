## Prompt — verbatim. Do not change its structure (see SKILL.md → "What you may change").

````text
<direction>
Build a robot-anime transformation: three vehicles that transform and combine into one robot as one self-contained HTML page with three.js.
Style: anime-style 3D CG: cel shading, bold outlines, speed lines, dramatic low angles.
Design the signature shot first, the one frame someone would screenshot, and build everything toward it.
Camera: a film camera, not orbit controls. Every shot uses one named move (dolly, crane, orbit, push-in, rack focus), eased in and out, and the camera never passes through geometry.
Light and materials: a key, fill and rim light with soft shadows, an environment map for reflections, fog for depth, physically based materials with varied roughness, ACES tone mapping. Nothing should look like a default material.
Motion: things react to each other (what's hit moves, what's near lights up), driven by springs or simple physics, never linear tweens.
Banned: default materials and lighting, floating text labels, glows on everything, a slowly spinning object as the whole idea, anything that looks like a tech demo.
</direction>

<structure>
The three vehicles race in, transform and lock together part by part, then the finished robot strikes a pose. Every join clicks into place with a flash of light.
Plan it as a shot list: an establishing wide, three to five shots that each have one camera move and one event, the signature shot, and a final wide that shows it in a new light.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file, three.js from a CDN, no build step. Model everything in code; no downloaded models or textures.
2. Use MeshPhysicalMaterial, a PMREM environment from RoomEnvironment, soft shadows, ACES tone mapping and antialiasing. Add depth of field only on shots that need it.
3. Hold 60fps on a laptop.
4. Add a ?render mode where every frame is computed from time (seeded randomness, no clock), so it can be captured with Playwright into an MP4 at 1080x1920.
5. Capture one frame per shot, look at it, and fix anything flat, aliased, clipping or hard to read.
</build>

<gotchas>
Set shadow bias, or surfaces get striped acne. Keep near and far planes tight, or distant surfaces flicker. Seed every random number, or the render won't match the preview.
</gotchas>

<start>
Describe the signature shot and the shot list in a few lines, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the HTML file and a 20-second MP4 captured with the ?render mode.
</start>
